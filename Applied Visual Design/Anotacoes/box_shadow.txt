The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes the following values, in order:

offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element)
offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element)
blur-radius
spread-radius
color
The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.
